These are some helper scripts that I started working on to automate some boring tasks in the game-ready asset pipeline. Still work in progress. I shared these for review purposes. Works in **Blender 2.8+**.

**Categorize Objects:** Move the objects in the scene to a proper collection according to their suffixes.</br>
**Validate Obj Names:** Checks the names of the objects in specific collections as if they are matching a naming convention.</br>
**Fix Mesh Data Names:** Renames all mesh data names to object names.</br>
