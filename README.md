These are some helper scripts that I started working on to automate some boring tasks in the game-ready asset pipeline. Still work in progress. I shared these for review purposes.

(**Blender 2.8+**)

##**Categorize Objects:**## Move the objects in the scene to a proper collection according to their suffixes.</br> ##**Validate Obj Names:**## Checks the names of the objects in specific collections as if they are matching a naming convention.</br> ##**Fix Mesh Data Names:**## Renames all mesh data names to object names.</br> ##**Copy to rest Pose:**## Transfers the CURRENT POSE of an armature to a target armature as REST POSE.</br>
